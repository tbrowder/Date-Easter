=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Date::Easter> is a module which provides a subroutine
to calculate the date of Easter in the Christian
calendar. The sub returns a Raku B<Date> object.

The routine's code is the Raku version of the algorithm shown
at L<Isn’t there a simpler way to calculate Easter?|https://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/easter.php#simplecalc>.
The website is a treasure trove of calendar information, courtesy
of the very generous and talented B<Claus Tøndering>, to whom I am greatly indebted.
